| **Social Proof** | 0-10 | Popular items with high engagement |
| **Novelty Bonus** | 0-5 | Items user hasn't seen yet |

**Algorithm Features:**
- ✅ Multi-factor scoring with configurable weights
- ✅ Top 10% randomization to avoid staleness
- ✅ Pagination support for infinite scroll
- ✅ Real-time adaptation to user behavior
- ✅ Fallback to trending items for new users

## 📊 User Activity Tracking

### New Activity Types

The `UserActivity` entity now tracks feed-specific interactions:

```typescript
export type ActivityType =
  | 'feed_view'        // User viewed an item in feed
  | 'feed_impression'  // Item shown in user's feed
  | 'feed_click'       // User clicked on item
  | 'feed_like'        // User liked item
  | 'feed_share'       // User shared item
  // ... existing types
```

### Helper Methods

```typescript
// Get recently viewed items
const viewedMints = userActivity.getRecentlyViewedItems(50);

// Get liked items
const likedMints = userActivity.getLikedItems();

// Get clicked items (purchase intent)
const clickedMints = userActivity.getClickedItems();

// Track interactions
userActivity.trackFeedView('mint123');
userActivity.trackFeedLike('mint123');
userActivity.trackFeedClick('mint123');
```
